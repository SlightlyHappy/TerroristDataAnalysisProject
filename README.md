# TerroristDataAnalysisProject
Old final project for college capstone class, this is a draft - the original is misplaced on my disk somewhere...

Reflection:
1. Ideas too broad, needed to narrow down on terrorsit group for accurate prediction model. 
2. Need guidance on what to focus on - dataset too big to navigate with little knowledge about terrorist activities.
